description: "When you don't have access to a hose, you can still get a pressurized clean outside with a handheld sprayer. Both this Zoro sprayer ($30) and this RL Flo-Master ($18) are tried and tested by our staff. If you're stuck inside, just throw your bike in the shower and clean it off there."
